# Custom Tmux Config

This is a custom tmux config I made for my workflow with few plugins and themes.

## How to use

1. Install tmux

1. clone the repo

```gh repo clone Chamal1120/Custom_tmux_config``` <br>or use git pull

3. Copy the `.tmux.conf` file to inside `~/.tmux/plugins/tmux` directory. Create the two folders if they aren't there.

2. Install the plugins that I have used

    - tpm - tmux plugin manager
    - vim-tmux-navigator - Enables seemless nagivation between vim buffers and tmux panes.

3. That's it!

## Important stuff you should know

 - I have changed the leader key (prefix) to `ctrl + s`. So whenever you want you the prefix, the that combination.
 - You can switch between panes using `prefix + %` for left and right and `prefix + "` for up and down. The same thing works to navigate between vim panes and tmux.

## Thank You
